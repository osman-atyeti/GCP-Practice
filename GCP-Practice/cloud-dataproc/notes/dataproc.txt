⚡ What is GCP Dataproc?
Dataproc is a fully managed Spark and Hadoop service on Google Cloud. It’s used to process big data using open-source tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Pig.

💡 Core Idea:
Run large-scale data processing jobs (ETL, batch, ML) using open-source big data tools — without managing infrastructure.

⚡ When to Use Dataproc?

Big data processing (batch or streaming)

Need to use Hadoop, Spark, Hive, or Pig

Migrate existing on-prem Hadoop workloads

Want full control over the cluster + flexibility

⚙️ Key Features:

Fully Managed: No need to manage Hadoop/Spark manually

Quick Cluster Spin-Up: In 90 seconds or less

Integrated with GCP: Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud Logging

Customizability: Add init actions, custom images

Autoscaling + Preemptible VMs support

Per-second billing

🧱 Dataproc Architecture:

Cluster (Master + Workers)

Jobs (Spark, PySpark, Hadoop, etc.)

Data in Cloud Storage / BigQuery

🔁 Job Flow Example:

Upload data to Cloud Storage

Create Dataproc Cluster

Submit job (e.g., PySpark script)

Processed results saved to Cloud Storage or BigQuery

Delete cluster (optional)

🆚 Dataproc vs Dataflow vs BigQuery:

Tool	Use Case	Type	Complexity
Dataproc	Hadoop/Spark-based processing	Open-source	More control
Dataflow	Stream/batch pipelines	Serverless	Less management
BigQuery	SQL-based analytics	Serverless	Simplest

🧠 Remember:

Use Cloud Storage as default file system

Can submit on-demand jobs without persistent clusters (via serverless Dataproc Serverless)

Useful for data engineers familiar with Spark or Hadoop
