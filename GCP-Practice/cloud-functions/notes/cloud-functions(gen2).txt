⚙️ Cloud Functions - Scaling & Concurrency
Typical Serverless Architecture:
Autoscaling: Spins up new instances for new invocations

Gen 1 Limitation: Only 1 request per instance

Result: 3 concurrent requests → 3 instances

❄️ Cold Start Problem:
Each new instance may have a cold start (slow start-up time)

🆚 Gen 1 vs Gen 2:
Feature	Gen 1	Gen 2
Concurrency	1 request	Up to 1000
Traffic splitting	❌ Not supported	✅ Supported
