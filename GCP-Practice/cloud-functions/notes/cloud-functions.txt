‚ö° What are Cloud Functions?
Cloud Functions are lightweight, event-driven compute solutions that let you run code in response to events without managing servers.

üí° Core Idea:
Run backend code automatically in response to events (e.g., file upload, HTTP request, log write, etc.) ‚Äî fully managed and serverless.

‚ö° When to Use Cloud Functions?

To execute code when something happens (event-driven)

Example: File upload to Cloud Storage or HTTP request received

‚ö° Key Features:

No Server Management: Auto-scales up/down based on traffic

Languages Supported: Node.js, Python, Go, Java, .NET, Ruby

Pay-as-you-go: Based on invocations, compute time, memory

Time-bound: Default 1 min, max 60 mins (3600 sec)

2 Versions Available:

Gen 1 (original)

Gen 2 (built on top of Cloud Run + Eventarc)

‚öôÔ∏è Trigger Concepts:

Event: The thing that happens (e.g., object upload)

Trigger: Defines what function to call when an event occurs

Function: Executes the logic when the trigger fires

üìå Events Can Be Triggered From:

Cloud Storage

Cloud Pub/Sub

HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)

Firebase

Cloud Firestore

Stackdriver Logging

üß† Important to Remember:

Cloud Functions scale horizontally

Not ideal for long-running processes

Best used for short, reactive operations
