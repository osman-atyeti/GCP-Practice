🔄 Data States
Data at Rest: Stored (e.g., disk, DB, backups)

Data in Motion: Being transferred (e.g., app to cloud, within cloud)

Data in Use: Being actively processed in memory

🔐 Encryption Basics
Why Encrypt? Prevent unauthorized data access (e.g., lost hard disk)

Defense in Depth: Encrypt hard disks, databases, file servers

Encrypt both: Data at rest and in transit

🔐 Symmetric Key Encryption
Same key used for encryption and decryption

🔑 Key Factors:

Right encryption algorithm

Securing the key

Sharing the key

🔐 Asymmetric Key Encryption
Uses Public Key + Private Key

Encrypt with Public, Decrypt with Private

Public = shared; Private = secret

Also called Public Key Cryptography

☁️ Cloud KMS (Key Management Service)
Manages cryptographic keys (symmetric + asymmetric)

Controls key usage in apps + GCP services

Provides API for encrypt/decrypt/sign

Integrates with most GCP services

Key types:

Google-managed (auto)

Customer-managed (via KMS)

Customer-supplied (your own)
