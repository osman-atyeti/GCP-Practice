💾 What is Block Storage?
Block Storage breaks data into equal-sized blocks, each with a unique identifier. Acts like a virtual hard drive.

🔧 Used For:

Operating system files

Databases

Application data

💡 Typically Attached to One VM

Can be used as DAS (Direct Attached Storage)

Or part of SAN (Storage Area Network)

🗂️ What is File Storage?
File Storage organizes data in folders/directories like a traditional file system.

🔧 Used For:

Media editing

Content sharing

Enterprise apps needing file access

💡 Easily Shared Between VMs

🌐 GCP Storage Types
📦 Block Storage in GCP:
Persistent Disks (PD)

Zonal (within one zone)

Regional (across two zones)

Detachable, resizable, durable

Local SSDs

Physically attached to VM

Temporary (data lost when VM stops)

High IOPS, low latency

📁 File Storage in GCP:
Filestore

Managed NFS (Network File System)

High-performance shared file storage

Suitable for shared workloads

🛠️ Block Storage Comparison
Feature	Persistent Disk (PD)	Local SSD
Attachment	Network	Direct physical
Lifecycle	Persistent	Ephemeral
Performance	Good	10–100x faster
Detachable?	Yes	No
Snapshot Support?	Yes	No
Use Case	Databases, apps	Caching, temp storage

💽 Persistent Disk Types
Type	Backing	IOPS	Use Case
Standard	HDD	Low	Sequential workloads
Balanced	SSD	Good	General-purpose
SSD	SSD	Very High	High-performance workloads

🌀 Snapshots in PD
Point-in-time backups

Incremental: Saves only changed data

Used for: Backup, disaster recovery, cloning

Can be automated & cross-project

📝 Best Practices:

Don’t snapshot too frequently (not >1/hour)

Avoid during peak I/O

Delete unused snapshots regularly

📷 Machine Images
Full VM backup (OS + metadata + disk)

Includes: Instance settings, boot disk, additional disks

Can recreate entire VM setup
