âš¡ What is Cloud Run?
Cloud Run is a fully managed compute platform that automatically scales your containerized applications.

ðŸ’¡ Core Idea:
Deploy containers (e.g., Docker) that can run over HTTP â€” serverless, scalable, and portable.

âš¡ When to Use Cloud Run?

When you want to run a web app, microservice, or API

When your app is packaged as a container

When you need custom libraries, runtimes, or binaries

âš¡ Key Features:

Fully Managed: No server management

Any Language/Library: If it runs in a container, it runs on Cloud Run

Stateless & Scalable: Handles 0 to millions of requests

Request-based billing: You only pay while your app is handling requests

Built-in HTTPS support

ðŸ“¦ What Can You Deploy?

Container image (from Docker or Cloud Build)

App exposing an HTTP server

Examples: Flask, Express.js, Java Spring Boot, etc.

ðŸš€ Cloud Run Flow:

Build container (locally or with Cloud Build)

Push to Container Registry or Artifact Registry

Deploy on Cloud Run

App is served via HTTPS endpoint

ðŸ†š Cloud Run vs Cloud Functions:

Feature	Cloud Run	Cloud Functions
Runtime	Any (via container)	Limited (Node.js, Python, etc.)
Use Case	Web apps, APIs	Small event-driven code
Startup	Slightly slower (cold start)	Faster
Flexibility	High	Limited

ðŸ§  Remember:

Stateless containers

Must listen on PORT env var

Timeout max: 60 minutes

Can use with Cloud Scheduler, Pub/Sub, etc. for event-driven architecture
